    Create a frequency bin conversion matrix used to obtain the Mel Spectrogram. This is called a *mel filter bank*,

    features is to approximate the non-linear human perception of the variation in pitch with respect to the frequency.
    This code is heavily inspired from the *torchaudio* implementation, see
    [here](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/transforms.html) for more details.


    Tips:
        - Different banks of Mel filters were introduced in the litterature. The following variation are supported:
            - MFCC FB-20: introduced in 1980 by Davis and Mermelstein, it assumes a sampling frequency of 10 kHertz
            and a speech bandwidth of `[0, 4600]` Hertz
            - MFCC FB-24 HTK: from the Cambridge HMM Toolkit (HTK) (1995) uses a filter bank of 24 filters for a
            speech bandwidth `[0, 8000]` Hertz (sampling rate â‰¥ 16 kHertz).
            - MFCC FB-40: from the Auditory Toolbox for MATLAB written by Slaney in 1998, assumes a sampling rate
            of 16 kHertz, and speech bandwidth [133, 6854] Hertz. This version also includes an area normalization.
            - HFCC-E FB-29 (Human Factor Cepstral Coefficients) of Skowronski and Harris (2004), assumes sampling
            rate of 12.5 kHertz and speech bandwidth [0, 6250] Hertz
        - The default parameters of `torchaudio`'s mel filterbanks implement the `"htk"` filers while `torchlibrosa`
        uses the `"slaney"` implementation.
